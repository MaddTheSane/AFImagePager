{"name":"AFImagePager","tagline":"The AFImagePager is inspired by foursquare's ImageSlideshow, the user may scroll through images loaded from the Web","body":"## AFImagePager\r\n\r\nThis UIView Subclass is used to present Images loaded from the Web and is inspired from foursquare's Image Slideshow. For async load of the Images AFNetworking is used, this has been added as a git Submodule. To initialize and checkout this Submodule after you clone the AFImagePager repository please do the following:\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\r\n```\r\n\r\nImplementing the ImagePager is fairly easy, just set it up in Interface Builder:\r\n![Setup in Interface Builder](http://kimar.github.io/screenshots/kiimagepager/ibsetup.png)\r\n\r\nOptionally customize the PageControl's appearance:\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\n- (void) viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated\r\n{\r\n    [super viewDidAppear:animated];\r\n    \r\n    _imagePager.pageControl.currentPageIndicatorTintColor = [UIColor lightGrayColor];\r\n    _imagePager.pageControl.pageIndicatorTintColor = [UIColor blackColor];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow implement it's DataSource and (optionally) Delegate methods:\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\n- (NSArray *) arrayWithImageUrlStrings\r\n{\r\n    return [NSArray arrayWithObjects:\r\n            @\"https://raw.github.com/kimar/tapebooth/master/Screenshots/Screen1.png\",\r\n            @\"https://raw.github.com/kimar/tapebooth/master/Screenshots/Screen2.png\",\r\n            @\"https://raw.github.com/kimar/tapebooth/master/Screenshots/Screen3.png\",\r\n            nil];\r\n}\r\n\r\n- (UIViewContentMode) contentModeForImage:(NSUInteger)image\r\n{\r\n    return UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFill;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is how it looks like, after you've set it up:\r\n\r\n![While loading the Image](http://kimar.github.io/screenshots/kiimagepager/1.png)\r\n![After loading the Image](http://kimar.github.io/screenshots/kiimagepager/2.png)\r\n\r\nThis project is modification of KIImagePager (https://github.com/kimar/KIImagePager).
